## <a href="#prerequisites" id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</a>

To run applications, an HFactory Server is needed. A fully-featured version can be downloaded free of charge and without prior registration from [hfactory.io](http://hfactory.io/getting-started/).

## <a href="#getting-started" id="getting-started">Getting started</a>

#### Start your own HFactory Server

To this end, you have three different options:
- Use the pre-configured [Docker image](http://hfactory.io/getting-started/docker-start/)
- Download the [HFactory Server archive](http://hfactory.io/getting-started/server-start/)
- Use the [Azure Sandbox](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/partners/ubeeko/hfactory-tools-sandbox/)

#### List of available open-source applications

| Application | Description                                                      | source                                        | build                                        |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Hotspot     | HBase web app using composite rowkeys for geographic coordinates | [github](https://github.com/hfactory/Hotspot) | [zip](https://github.com/hfactory/Hotspot/releases) |

#### Launch open-source apps

- Copy or unzip the application folder exported in /usr/local/hfactory-server/apps (or in your custom app store path)
- Go to the server administration page http://localhost:18090 by default
- Create the tables if needed
- Start the application
- Click the application name once it is started

#### Build your own custom apps

Full documentation and build instructions are readily available in our [App Developer Guide](http://hfactory.io/documentation/app-developer-guide/). Once you are done, you can obviously keep your apps in-house or decide to <a href="#contributing">share</a> part or all of them with the community.
